### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Kishore S, pursuing MTech in Data Science and Machine Learning.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Natural Language processing
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Big Data
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for internships
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, Machine Learning
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: kishoresshankar@gmail.com


These are some of the projects that I have done for academic puropse, self learning and passion for Data Science.

- ### Open Source Projects
  - [Fast Report](https://github.com/kishore-s-gowda/fastreport): Fast Report is my first contribution towards open source projects. Using this package the performance of different algorithms like Random Forest, Xgboost, Logistic Regression etc. on any data can be obtained with the help of single line of code. The package is built mainly using Sklearn library.The package can be downloaded from [here](https://pypi.org/project/fastreport/)

- ### Machine Learning Projects
 
  - [Mobile Price Range Prediction](https://github.com/kishore-s-gowda/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Mobile%20Price%20Range%20Prediction(Classification))
  - [Anime Recommendation System](https://github.com/kishore-s-gowda/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Recommendation%20System)
  - [Seoul Bike Rental prediction using linear regression](https://github.com/kishore-s-gowda/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Seoul%20Bike%20Rental%20prediction%20using%20linear%20regression)

- ### Deep Learning Projects
  - [Cars classification using Transfer learning with Deployment](https://github.com/kishore-s-gowda/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Cars%20classification%20using%20Transfer%20learning%20with%20Deployment): The images belonging to 18 different models of car was collected. Diffrent architecture were used for classification. Transfer learning model(MobileNet) gave the highest accuracy so it has been considered for deployment. Deployment of model has been using gradio library.
  - [Breast Cancer Classification using ANN](https://github.com/kishore-s-gowda/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Artificial%20Neural%20Networks%20(ANN))
  - [Malaria Cell Image Detection using CNN](https://github.com/kishore-s-gowda/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Convolutional%20Neural%20Network(%20CNN))
  - [Time Series forecasting using RNN](https://github.com/kishore-s-gowda/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks%20(RNN))
